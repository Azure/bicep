Note: this sample should be deployed once to establish the vWAN Virtual Hub and enable Routing, and then re-deployed again once Routing has been enabled; this is due to a current limitation in vWAN.

Note: the Connections have manual dependencies defined as they can only be updated in serial rather than parallel.
