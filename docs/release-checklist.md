# Bicep Release Checklist

1. (**end-of-month releases only**) Update Bicep Az types:
    1. Run the [Update Types](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-types-az/actions/workflows/update-types.yml) GitHub Action to generate the latest type definitions.
    1. Wait ~3hrs for the previous step to complete. Ensure it runs successfully, and generates + merges a PR (example [here](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-types-az/pull/1299)).
    1. Run the Official Build (see [this README](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_git/BicepMirror-Types-Az) for instructions).
    1. Publish Bicep.Types NuGet packages to nuget.org. Follow the latter half of the readme [here](https://dev.azure.com/msazure/One/_git/BicepMirror-Types-Az) and the below steps.
        1. Find your build [here](https://dev.azure.com/msazure/One/_build?definitionId=179851&_a=summary) and wait for it to finish successfully. Then click on it and for the `drop_build_main`, download the artifacts.
        1. Follow instructions to download the nuget.exe from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/install-nuget-client-tools)
        1. Run `./scripts/UploadPackages.ps1 -PackageDirectory <downloads>/drop_build_main -NuGetPath <nuget_tool_directory>`
        1. You need to be part of the armdeployments org on nuget.org. (Ask one of the admins to be added) You must generate an API key and then use that as the password for when the popup window appears after running the above command. (Username can be anything)
    1. Bump the Bicep.Types NuGet package version in this project in this [file](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/blob/main/src/Bicep.Core/Bicep.Core.csproj) by creating and merging a PR
        1. Might need to run a `dotnet refresh` to update the packages.lock.json files
        1. Might also need to update baseline tests (run `bicep/scripts/SetBaseline.ps1`)
1. Verify the latest build on the `main` branch is green: ![Build on main](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main).
1. Review history for changes to [bicepconfig.schema.json](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/commits/main/src/vscode-bicep/schemas/bicepconfig.schema.json). Raise an issue for any recently-added linter rules which do not have public documentation.
1. (**end-of-month releases only**) Bump the version number by incrementing the minor version number in [this file](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/blob/main/version.json) (example [here](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/pull/9698))
1. Run the Official Build (see [this README](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_git/BicepMirror) for instructions).
1. Get version number from official build by looking at the artifacts and push a new tag to the Bicep repo. This should be of format `vXX.YY.ZZ` - e.g `v0.14.85`.
    1. In the Bicep repo, make sure you are on the main branch and on the latest commit.
    1. Run git tag v<new_release_number> (ex: git tag v0.15.31)
    1. Run git push origin v<new_release_number> (ex: git push origin v0.15.31)
1. [Create a draft release](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/new) for the new tag and set release title to the tag name. Use the "Save draft" button to save the changes without publishing it.
1. Run `bicep/scripts/CreateReleaseNotes -FromTag <previous tag> -ToTag <new tag>` and set the output as the release description.
    1. Give the output of this script to a PM, and ask them to clean up the notes for the release.
    1. Once they have cleaned up the notes, copy + paste them into the draft notes, and hit "Save draft" again.
1. Run `BicepMirror/scripts/UploadSignedReleaseArtifacts.ps1` to add official artifacts to the release.
    * `-WorkingDir` can be any empty temporary directory that you create
    * `-BuildId` is only needed if the latest official build is NOT the official build you are trying to release
1. Validate VSCode extension and Bicep CLI manually on Windows, Mac & Linux:
    1. Download `vscode-bicep.vsix` from the draft release, and [Install it from VSIX](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix). Verify that you can open a Bicep file, that text is correctly colorized, and that error messages show up as expected.
    1. Download the appropriate Bicep executable for your platform (e.g. `bicep-linux-x64`). Verify you can invoke it with e.g. `bicep-linux-x64 --version`, and that it prints the expected output.
1. Publish the release on GitHub.
1. Upload copyleft dependency source to 3rd party disclosure site. See [instructions](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_wiki/wikis/Azure%20Deployments%20Team%20Wiki/369910/Bicep-release-step-Upload-copyleft-source-to-3rd-party-disclosure-site).
1. Upload vscode-bicep.VSIX to the VS marketplace [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage).
    1. Click on the ... for Bicep, then Update, then upload the .vsix file. The site will verify it then the version number should be updated to the right one. 
1. Upload vs-bicep.VSIX to VS marketplace
    1. Click on the ... for Bicep for Visual Studio, then Edit. Once on the new page, upload the new vs-bicep.VSIX file at the top. This should update the Version number automatically for you. Verify that it does then scroll to the bottom and hit Save and Upload.
1. Upload NuGet packages to nuget.org via `./scripts/PublishPackages.ps1`. (Make sure to include CLI packages. Easiest is to use the `__assets` directory created by the `UploadSignedReleaseArtifacts.ps1` script.)
1. Update homebrew by going here [here](https://github.com/Azure/homebrew-bicep/actions/workflows/update-homebrew.yml) and clicking on `Run workflow`
    * A PR will be auto created by this action (example [here](https://github.com/Azure/homebrew-bicep/pull/40)). Approve and merge it.
