# Resources
A `resource` declaration defines a resource that will be either created or updated at deployment time along with its intended state. The resource is also assigned to an identifier. You can reference the identifier in [expressions](./expressions.md) that are part of [variables](./variables.md), [outputs](./outputs), or other `resource` declarations.

Consider the following declaration that creates or updates a [DNS Zone](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-zones-records):
```
resource dnsZone 'Microsoft.Network/dnszones@2018-05-01' = {
  name: 'myZone'
  location: 'global'
}
```

## Declaration Components
A `resource` declaration consists of the following components:
- `resource` keyword
- An identifier (`dnsZone` in the example) that can be used in [expressions](./expressions.md) to reference the resource. The identifier does not impact the name of the resource. A resource cannot have the same identifier as any [parameter](./parameters.md), [variable](./variables.md), or another resource in the same scope.
- Resource type + API version (`Microsoft.Network/dnsZones` and `2018-05-01` in the example, respectively)
- Resource body. DNS Zones do not require complicated configuration, so we are only setting the `name` and `location` properties in the example.


## Resource Type
A resource type itself (`Microsoft.Network/dnszones@2018-05-01` in our example) consists of the following components:
- An optional provider prefix. The default provider is Azure Resource Manager whose prefix is `az://`
- A provider-specific resource type. In the case of the `az` provider, the resource type is of the form: `<ARM resource provider namespace>/<ARM resource type(s)>@<ARM API version>`.

Common `az` resource types include:
- `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets@2018-10-01`
- `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets@2018-11-01`
- `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments@2018-09-01-preview`

Their fully qualified equivalents would be:
- `az://Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets@2018-10-01`
- `az://Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets@2018-11-01`
- `az://Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments@2018-09-01-preview`

> **Note**: Provider prefixes such as `az://` are not yet implemented.

A full `resource` declaration with a fully qualified resource type looks like the following:
```
resource dnsZone 'Microsoft.Network/dnszones@2018-05-01' = {
  name: 'myZone'
  location: 'global'
}
```

## Resource nesting

A resource declaration may appear inside another resource declaration when the inner resource is a child type of the containing resource. A nested resource is considered to have an implicit dependency on its containing resource for creation order. 

```
resource myParent 'My.Rp/parentType@2020-01-01' = {
  name: 'myParent'
  location: 'West US'

  // declares a resource of type 'My.Rp/parentType/childType@2020-01-01' 
  resource myChild 'childType' = {
    name: 'myChild'
    properties: {
      displayName: 'child in ${parent.location}'
    }
  }
}
```

A nested resource must specify a single type segment to declare its type. The full type of the nested resource is the containing resource's type with the additional segment appended to the list of types. In the example above `My.Rp/parentType@2020-01-01` is combined with `childType` resulting in `My.Rp/parentType/childType@2020-01-01`. The nested resource may optionally declare an API version using the syntax `<segment>@<version>`. If the nested resource omits the API version the the API version of the containing resource is used. If the nested resource specifies an API version then the API version specified will be used. If the example above were modified so that the nested resource declared its type as `childType@2020-20-20` then the fully-qualified type would be `My.Rp/parentType/childType@2020-20-20`.

Nested resource declarations should specify their `name` property with a single segment. The the example above the nested resource declares its `name` property with the value `myChild`. In ARM-JSON, child resources must declared their `name` property as a `/`-separated string containing multiple segments like: `myParent/myChild` - this is not required with nested resources.

A nested resource declaration must appear at the top level of syntax of the containing resource. Declarations may be nested arbirarily deep, as long as each level is a child type of its containing resource. 

The symbolic name of a nested resource is only accessible inside the body of its containing resource. 

A nested resource may access properties of its containing resource. Other resources declared inside the body of the same containing resource may reference each other and the typical rules about cyclic-dependencies apply. A containing resource may not access properties of the resources it contains, this would cause a cyclic-dependency.

## Resource dependencies
All declared resources will be deployed concurrently in the compiled template. Order of resource deployment can be influenced in the following ways:
### Explicit dependency
An explicit dependency is declared via the `dependsOn` property within the resource declaration. The property accept an array of resource identifiers. Here is an example of one DNS zone depending on another explicitly:
```
resource dnsZone 'Microsoft.Network/dnszones@2018-05-01' = {
  name: 'myZone'
  location: 'global'
}

resource otherZone 'Microsoft.Network/dnszones@2018-05-01' = {
  name: 'myZone'
  location: 'global'
  dependsOn: [
    dnsZone
  ]
}
```

### Implicit dependency
An implicit dependency will be created when one resource declaration references the identifier of another resource declaration in an expression. Here's an example:
```
resource dnsZone 'Microsoft.Network/dnszones@2018-05-01' = {
  name: 'myZone'
  location: 'global'
}

resource otherResource 'Microsoft.Example/examples@2020-06-01' = {
  name: 'exampleResource'
  properties: {
    // get read-only DNS zone property
    nameServers: dnsZone.properties.nameServers
  }
}
```

A nested resource has an implicit dependency on its containing resource.

```
resource myParent 'My.Rp/parentType@2020-01-01' = {
  name: 'myParent'
  location: 'West US'

  // depends on 'myParent' implicitly
  resource myChild 'childType' = {
    name: 'myChild'
  }
}
```

## Conditions

> Requires Bicep CLI v0.2.212 or later

Resources may be deployed if and only if a specified condition evaluated to `true`. Otherwise, resource deployment will be skipped. This is accomplished by adding a `if` keyword and a boolean expression to the resource declaration. The template compiled from the below example will deploy the DNS zone if the `deployZone` parameter evaluates to `true`:
```
param deployZone bool

resource dnsZone 'Microsoft.Network/dnszones@2018-05-01' = if (deployZone) {
  name: 'myZone'
  location: 'global'
}
```

Conditions may be used with dependency declarations. If the identifier of conditional resource is specified in `dependsOn` of another resource (explicit dependency), the dependency will be ignored if the condition evaluates to `false` at template deployment time. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the dependency will be respected. Referencing a property of a conditional resource (implicit dependency) is allowed but may produce a runtime error in some cases.

## Referencing existing resources

> Requires Bicep CLI v0.3 or later

You may add references and access runtime properties from resources outside of the current file by using the `existing` keyword in a resource declaration. This is equivalent to using the ARM Template `reference()` function.

When using the `existing` keyword, you must provide the `name` of the resource, and may optionally also set the `scope` property to access a resource in a different scope. See [Resource Scopes](./resource-scopes.md) for more information on using the `scope` property.

```bicep
// this resource will not be deployed by this file, but the declaration provides access to properties on the existing resource.
resource stg 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2019-06-01' existing = {
  name: 'myacc'
}

// the 'stg' symbolic name may now be used to access properties on the storage account.
output blobEndpoint string = stg.properties.primaryEndpoints.blob
```

```bicep
// example of referencing a resource at a different scope (resource group myRg under subscription mySub)
resource stg 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2019-06-01' existing = {
  name: 'myacc'
  scope: resourceGroup(mySub, myRg)
}
```

## Other Examples

### Storage Account
```
resource myStorageAccount `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2017-10-01` = {
  name: storageAccountName
  location: resourceGroup().location
  properties: {
    supportsHttpsTrafficOnly: true
    accessTier: 'Hot'
    encryption: {
      keySource: 'Microsoft.Storage'
      services: {
        blob: {
          enabled: true
        }
        file: {
          enabled: true
        }
      }
    }
  }
  kind: StorageV2
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
}
```
