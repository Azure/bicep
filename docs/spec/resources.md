# Resources
A `resource` declaration defines a resource that will be either created or updated at deployment time along with its intended state. The resource is also assigned to an identifier. You can reference the identifier in [expressions](./expressions.md) that are part of [variables](./variables.md), [outputs](./outputs), or other `resource` declarations.

Consider the following declaration that creates or updates a [DNS Zone](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-zones-records):
```
resource dnsZone 'Microsoft.Network/dnszones@2018-05-01': {
  name: 'myZone'
  location: 'global'
}
```

## Declaration Components
A `resource` declaration consists of the following components:
- `resource` keyword
- An identifier (`dnsZone` in the example) that can be used in [expressions](./expressions.md) to reference the resource. The identifier does not impact the name of the resource. A resource cannot have the same identifier as any [parameter](./parameters.md), [variable](./variables.md), or another resource in the same scope.
- Resource type + API version (`Microsoft.Network/dnsZones` and `2018-05-01` in the example, respectively)
- Resource body. DNS Zones do not require complicated configuration, so we are only setting the `name` and `location` properties in the example.


## Resource Type
A resource type itself (`Microsoft.Network/dnszones@2018-05-01` in our example) consists of the following components:
- An optional provider prefix. The default provider is Azure Resource Manager whose prefix is `azrm://`
- A provider-specific resource type. In the case of the `azrm` provider, the resource type is of the form: `<ARM resource provider namespace>/<ARM resource type(s)>@<ARM API version>`.

Common `azrm` resource types include:
- `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets@2018-10-01`
- `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets@2018-11-01`
- `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments@2018-09-01-preview`

Their fully qualified equivalents would be:
- `azrm://Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets@2018-10-01`
- `azrm://Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets@2018-11-01`
- `azrm://Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments@2018-09-01-preview`

A full `resource` declaration with a fully qualified resource type looks like the following:
```
resource dnsZone 'Microsoft.Network/dnszones@2018-05-01': {
  name: 'myZone'
  location: 'global'
}
```

## Other Examples

### Storage Account
```
resource myStorageAccount `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2017-10-01`: {
  name: storageAccountName
  location: resourceGroup().location
  properties: {
    supportsHttpsTrafficOnly: true
    accessTier: 'Hot'
    encryption: {
      keySource: 'Microsoft.Storage'
      services: {
        blob: {
          enabled: true
        }
        file: {
          enabled: true
        }
      }
    }
  }
  kind: StorageV2
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
}
```
