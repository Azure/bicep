# No unused parameters

**Code**: no-unused-params

**Description**: To reduce confusion in your template, delete any parameters that are defined but not used. This test finds any parameters that aren't used anywhere in the template. Eliminating unused parameters also makes it easier to deploy your template because you don't have to provide unnecessary values.
