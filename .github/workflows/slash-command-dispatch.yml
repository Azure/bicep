# Implements "slash commands" on PR comments
#   see https://github.com/peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch
#   and https://david.gardiner.net.au/2021/05/dependabot-nuget-lockfiles.html
# Listens for a comment on a pull request beginning with "/{command}" and dispatches that command
# E.g. commenting "/lockfiles" will dispatch the "lockfiles-command.yml" workflow
#
# Note: An "eyes" icon is added when the command has been seen, and a "rocket" icon when the command has been dispatched
