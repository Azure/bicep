# Bicep Local Deploy Extensions

Bicep Local Deploy is an experimental feature that enables you to author Bicep files using extensions designed to run fully locally, without requiring an Azure connection. These extensions allow you to manage non-Azure resources and services directly from Bicep templates, such as GitHub repositories, Kubernetes clusters, local file operations, and HTTP API calls. Extensions can be combined to create powerful infrastructure workflows that span multiple platforms and services.
